# JS-Mobile

Objective: In this lab, you will be developing a JavaScript-only full stack with a Mobile First Design strategy, creating a front end that can be used on the go to read and write to an AGOL database. 

This lab's main objective is to develop a mobile-first full-stack application using only JavaScript programming language. Mobile First Design strategy means the design will be optimized for mobile devices and scaled to desktop devices. The goal is to create a front-end interface that can be easily used on the go to read and write to an ArcGIS Online (AGOL) database. 

The plan is to create a location-enabled data collection website to accomplish the lab's objective. This website will enable users to collect data from their smartphone or desktop web browsers, and the collected data will be written and updated in datasets stored on AGOL.
